## Quick Start

1. Disable the built-in VSCode PHP Language Features. Extensions -> Search `@builtin php` -> PHP Language Features -> Disable.
Note that other PHP extensions which provide similar functionality should also be disabled for best results.
2. Add glob patterns for non standard php file extensions to the `files.associations` setting. For example, `*.module`. Settings -> Search `files`.
3. View settings for further configuration options. Settings -> Search `intelephense`.
